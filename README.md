AutoHotkey Defaults
===================

These files are for AutoHotkey v1.

Including them will improve the compatibility of your source code with AutoHotkey v2 and improve debugging.

Defaults.ahk and FastDefaults.ahk differ only in that FastDefaults.ahk turns off debugging support to improve speed.
